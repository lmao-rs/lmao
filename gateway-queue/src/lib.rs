//! Ratelimiting functionality for queueing new gateway sessions.
//!
//! The gateway ratelimits how often clients can initialize new sessions.
//! Instances of a queue are given to shards so that they can request to
//! initialize a session.
//!
//! Queue implementations must point to the same broker so that all shards
//! across all clusters, processes, and other forms of multi-serviced
//! applications, can work together and use the same ratelimiting source. That
//! is, if you for example have two clusters in two different processes, then
//! the two processes must use some unified form of ratelimiting: this can
//! either mean using IPC to communicate ratelimiting or a broker.
//!
//! # Provided queues
//!
//! Most users only need the [`LocalQueue`]: it's a single-process queue for
//! smaller bots. Larger bots need the [`LargeBotQueue`], which supports
//! single-process [Sharding for Very Large Bots] through the use of bucket
//! releasing.
//!
//! By default, the gateway's `Cluster` and `Shard`s use the [`LocalQueue`]. You
//! can override this in the `ClusterBuilder::queue` and `ShardBuilder::queue`
//! configuration methods.
//!
//! # Advanced use cases
//!
//! Large bots, and smaller bots out of design, may need to implement their own
//! queue. The most common reason to need this is if you have clusters in
//! multiple processes. You'll need a broker to manage ratelimiting across them
//! all so a [`Queue`] trait is provided that shards can use to make requests to
//! create sessions.
