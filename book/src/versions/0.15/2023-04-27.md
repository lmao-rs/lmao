# 2023-04-27 Updates

We've published minor versions of a number of crates. This release is composed
of bugfixes, new features, performance improvements, documentation improvements,
and dependency updates.

## Bugfixes

Discord's Clyde AI bot has a unique avatar hash. Unlike other hashes that are
hex based, Clyde's avatar hash is simply "clyde". We now handle deserialization
of Clyde's avatar in our [`ImageHash`] optimization.

Application command interaction options of type `String` are no longer trimmed
of leading zeroes.

The [`UpdateCurrentMember`] request now correctly removes the current member's
nickname if passed `None`.

The [gateway queue]'s [`DayLimiter`] now properly calculates when the session
resets.

The [`UpdateGuildSticker`] request now uses the specified audit log reason;
prior, it was accidentally ignoring the reason.

## Dependency Updates

The allowed version range of `simd-json` was broadened to `>=0.4, <0.10` in
twilight-gateway and twilight-http.

## Documentation Improvements

[`Standby`] now has an example of how to timeout futures and streams.

The [`Event::IntegrationDelete`] and [`Event::IntegrationUpdate`] variants'
documentation was inversed, and has now been corrected.

## Feature Additions

The [`AutoModerationTriggerMetadata`] struct now supports the
`mention_total_limit` and `regex_patterns` fields.

The guild [`Permissions`] bitflag now supports the
`VIEW_CREATOR_MONETIZATION_ANALYTICS` and `USE_SOUNDBOARD` variants and renames
`MANAGE_EMOJIS_AND_STICKERS` to `MANAGE_GUILD_EXPRESSIONS`.

The [`Interaction`] struct now supports the `channel` field.

## Performance Improvements

The gateway's [`CommandRatelimiter`] performance has been improved by over 98%,
with common calls being reduced from around 4 microseconds to around 57
nanoseconds. This is something that can be used by users, and is also used by
shards when sending commands, making common operations just a bit more speedy.
Impressive!

Avatars, banners, icons, and other assets are received as hashes, which we have
[`ImageHash`] for as a performance improvement in storage. Instead of storing
hashes as heap-allocated strings, we store them as 16 bytes on the stack. The
performance of the deserialization and parsing of hashes is now 38% faster.

Caching users received in [`InteractionCreate`]  events is now a bit faster in
some situations due to [keying into a HashMap][`HashMap::get`] to check for the
existence of a user instead of [iterating over the HashMap][`HashMap::iter`].
