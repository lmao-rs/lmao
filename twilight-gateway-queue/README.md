Rate limiting functionality for gateway `IDENTIFY` commands.

Discord allows bot's shards to send a limited amount of `IDENTIFY` commands
every 5 seconds, with a daily limit from 1000 to 2000 commands, and invalidates
*all* shard sessions upon exceeding it. Each identify interval may be filled by
shards' IDs modulo `max_concurrency` and such a set of shards is called a
bucket. See [Discord Docs/Sharding].

To coordinate this, a [`Queue`] should process each identify request and shards
should wait for its signal to proceed before continuing and otherwise retry. The
provided [`InMemoryQueue`] never fails or cancels requests and is therefore a
good starting point for custom implementations. It can also be composed to
support multiple processes; see [`gateway-queue-http`] and [`gateway-queue`] for
a HTTP client and server implementation, respectively.
